module Perennial
  # = Perennial::Daemon provides a relatively simple
  # interface to creating unix daemons from a given process.
  # Namely, it focuses on three providing tools for
  # a couple of simple purposes.
  #
  # == Turning a process into a daemon
  #
  # This approach is as as simple as calling
  # Perennial::Daemon.daemonize! - the current process
  # will then be a daemon, the non-daemon processes
  # will be killed and if started by the loader, it will
  # also write a pid out.
  #
  # == Checking whether a process is alive
  #
  # Perennial::Daemon.alive?(pid) is a super simple way
  # to check if a pid (as an integer) is current active / alive,
  # 
  # Perennial::Daemon.any_alive? takes a type and tells you if
  # any processes with the associated type are alive.
  #
  # == Storing / Retrieving Pids for a Given Loader Type
  #
  # Perennial::Daemon.daemonize! will store the pid for
  # the current process if Perennial::Loader.current_type
  # is present.
  #
  # Perennial::Daemon.any_alive?(type = :all) and
  # Perennial::Daemon.kill_all(type = :all) can be
  # used to deal with checking the status of and killing
  # processes associated with a given loader type.

        return Process.getpgid(pid) != -1
      rescue Errno::ESRCH
        return false
      end
      
      # Kills all processes associated with a certain app type.
      # E.g. Given a loader is starting a :client, kill_all(:client)
      # would kill all associated processes (usually after daemonizing)
      # and kill_all would do the same - but if we also started
      # a process for :server, kill_all(:client wouldn't kill the
      # the process where as kill_all would.
